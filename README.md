# phpcov

**phpcov** is a command-line frontend for the PHP_CodeCoverage library.

## Installation

### PHP Archive (PHAR)

The easiest way to obtain PHPCOV is to download a [PHP Archive (PHAR)](http://php.net/phar) that has all required dependencies of PHPCOV bundled in a single file:

    wget https://phar.phpunit.de/phpcov.phar
    chmod +x phpcov.phar
    mv phpcov.phar /usr/local/bin/phpcov

You can also immediately use the PHAR after you have downloaded it, of course:

    wget https://phar.phpunit.de/phpcov.phar
    php phpcov.phar

### Composer

Simply add a dependency on `phpunit/phpcov` to your project's `composer.json` file if you use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to manage the dependencies of your project. Here is a minimal example of a `composer.json` file that just defines a development-time dependency on PHPCOV:

    {
        "require-dev": {
            "phpunit/phpcov": "*"
        }
    }

For a system-wide installation via Composer, you can run:

    composer global require 'phpunit/phpcov=*'

Make sure you have `~/.composer/vendor/bin/` in your path.

### PEAR Installer

The following two commands (which you may have to run as `root`) are all that is required to install PHPCOV using the PEAR Installer:

    pear config-set auto_discover 1
    pear install pear.phpunit.de/phpcov
